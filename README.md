Introduction of Final Project

The purpose of this project is to allow us to work collaboratively. Also, to develop different metric ideas for each of us to analyze. In other words, we can present our ideas to others on how to determine the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh from our perspective. Overall, we need to use different metrics and their datasets to see and compare the best community. Then, we come up with a conclusion with the result of our findings.
