Introduction:
     The purpose of this project is to determine the factors we can use to decide on the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh. In my opinion, the environment 
     is one of the significant elements for a good neighborhood, including the other two that my group have mentioned. Additionally, air quality is the metric
     that I will be focusing on for the project. 


The Metric:
    The metric that I will mainly focus on is air quality. That is because new air conditioning brings attention from more people
    because of the climate change issues. Therefore, the best neighborhood should generally know the importance of ensuring their air quality is good. 
    So, I will do this part by categorizing them based on the data from WPRDC. Which will be easier for the users to read through.
